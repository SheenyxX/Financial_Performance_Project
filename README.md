## 🌐 Data Organization & Structure
Modern enterprises like NorthWind Traders organize financial data into **4 core datasets**, optimized for ERP integration and BI tools like Power BI:

### 1. **Transactional Data** (`GL.xlsx`)  
- **What It Contains**: Every financial transaction (debits/credits) with metadata:  
  - *Account Codes* (e.g., `230` for Cost of Sales)  
  - *Timestamps* (date of transaction)  
  - *Geographic Tags* (Territory keys)
  - *Amount* (transaction value)
- **Volume**: 27,910+ transactions spanning 3 years
- **Typical Use**: Foundation for P&L statements, balance sheets, and cash flow analysis

### 2. **Master Data** (`Chart of Accounts.xlsx`)  
- **What It Contains**: Hierarchical mapping of accounts with multi-level classification:
  - **Level 1**: Report Type (Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss)
  - **Level 2**: Class (Trading, Operating, Non-operating)
  - **Level 3**: SubClass (Sales, COGS, Marketing, etc.)
  - **Level 4**: SubClass2 (Detailed categorization)
- **Corporate Standard**: Follows FASB/IFRS compliance structures used by SAP/Oracle

### 3. **Dimensional Data** (`Territory.xlsx`, `Calendar.xlsx`)  
- **Territory**: Geographic segmentation with 7 regions:
  - North America: USA, Canada
  - Europe: UK, France, Germany
  - Asia-Pacific: Australia, New Zealand
- **Calendar**: 3-year fiscal periods (1,097 days):
  - Year → Quarter → Month → Day
  - Special flags for fiscal year boundaries
- **Why It Matters**: Enables multi-dimensional analysis across time/region

### 4. **Relational Model**  
The data structure follows a star schema design for optimal query performance:
- Central fact table (`General Ledger`) connected to three dimension tables
- One-to-many relationships from dimensions to transactions
- No direct relationships between dimension tables to prevent circular dependencies
- Optimized for both aggregation (summaries) and drilling down to transaction details

This enterprise-grade data architecture enables the complex analysis presented in this dashboard suite while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

## 🔬 Technical Backbone  

### Full DAX Implementation (10 Measures)  
```dax
// Base Measures
Total_FTP = SUM('General Ledger'[Amount])  // Core transactional sum
Sales_FTP = CALCULATE([Total_FTP], 'Chart of Accounts'[SubClass] = "Sales")  // Revenue isolation

// Profitability
GrossProfit = CALCULATE([Total_FTP], 'Chart of Accounts'[Class] = "Trading account")  
GrossProfit_Margin = DIVIDE([GrossProfit], [Sales_FTP], 0)  // Margin analysis

Net_Profit = CALCULATE([Total_FTP], 'Chart of Accounts'[Report] = "Profit and Loss")  
NetProfit_Margin = DIVIDE([Net_Profit], [Sales_FTP], 0)  // Bottom-line efficiency

// Cost & Operations
Operating_Profit = CALCULATE([Total_FTP], 
    'Chart of Accounts'[Class] = "Trading account" || 
    'Chart of Accounts'[Class] = "Operating account")  // Core business health

PBIT = [Operating_Profit] + CALCULATE([Total_FTP], 'Chart of Accounts'[Class] = "Non-operating")  // Broad profitability

Marketing_Cost_FTP = CALCULATE([Total_FTP], 'Chart of Accounts'[SubClass2] = "Marketing") * -1  // Spend tracking

EBITDA = [GrossProfit] + CALCULATE([Total_FTP], 'Chart of Accounts'[SubClass] = "Operating Expenses")  // Cash flow proxy
```

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations  
1. **Fix the Leaks**  
   - Replace UK warehouse partner (saves **$45K/yr** in delays)  
   - Adopt France's vendor contracts in Germany  

2. **Double Down on Strength**  
   - **USA**: Add Q3 temporary staff (est. **+$220K profit**)  
   - **NZ**: Test 10% price increase (demand elasticity = 1.2)  

3. **System Upgrades**  
   - Live marketing ROI dashboard for CMO  
   - Auto-flag cost variances >5% using:  
     ```dax
     Cost_Variance_Alert = 
     IF(ABS([Actual_Cost] - [Budget_Cost]) > 0.05 * [Budget_Cost], "Review", "OK")
     ```
